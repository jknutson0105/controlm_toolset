# Readme File  
The purpose of this work is to be able to create tickets on a Service Now instance
  * If the ticket is for a job  
    - The ticket will contain log for all executions up until that in case of repeated runs  
    - The ticket will contain output for the current execution only  
    - The ticket will contain a link to open the job neighborhood in Control-M Self Service
  * If the ticket is not for a job related alert
    - It will contain basic information


## Relevant files  
  * crtsnowticket.sh  
    - file that processes the alert and sends the incident to Service Now
  * tktvars.json  
    - file that contains variables per environment (script will not be much faster if they were hardcoded)  
    - directory for log file specified must be in tktvars.json
  * installjq.sh  
    - script to be run as root to install jq (json query tool)  
  * installAAPI.sh
    - script to be run as root to install the AAPI if not available  
  * Folder_DCO_SNow.xml  
    - Set of Control-M jobs to manage the ticketing  
  * README.md  
    - This file  

## Requirements:
  * Control-M EM parameters
    - check http://documents.bmc.com/supportu/9.0.19/help/Main_help/en-US/index.htm#45710.htm
    - Search in the page below for SendAlarmToScript
        - http://documents.bmc.com/supportu/9.0.19/help/Main_help/en-US/index.htm#2283.htm
  * Ticketing application  
    - Must have a valid API user with proper permissions.  
    - Consult your Documentationor ask your Support team for proper permissions.  
  * Control-M AAPI CLI  
    -   Ensure the proper environment is created under the user that will connect to the EM.  
    -   If the user needs to retrieve from the mainframe, ensure that the proper equivalences are set.  
    -   The DS API ID is assigned to the IOA user on the PARM(EMUSREQ) (or similar)
  * jq  
    -   jq must be installed to process json objects. (see installjq.sh)
  * Modify crtsnowticket.sh to ensure tktvars.json is in the right location  
    -   By default, the script expects the var file in the same directory. Change if needed.
  * Modify tktvars.json  
    -   The file may contain unencrypted credentials.

## Future work
  * Convert credentials to secrets  
    -   use ctm config secrets to store the passwords
  * next future work

## Service Now developer instance
  * Sign up for a developer instance at https://developer.servicenow.com
  * Once the instance is available, you will be provided with a URL
    - Enter the URL in the json file
    - You will be assigned an admin user password.
  * ONLY for the developer instance
    - at the admin console use the action to delete all demo data
    - The activity takes about 30 minutes.
  * Create a user. Note the username and password to enter in the json file.
  * Assign the following roles
    - rest_api_explorer
    - web_service_admin
  * If desired, marked the user as "Web service access only"
    - create another user for regular access if you prefer not to use the admin user.
  * Create a user called ctmuser for interactive access
    - assign password ctmpass
    - assign admin role
  * There will be some limitation to the file sizes and file extensions that can be overwritten. The script does not violate those limitation, but modifications may.
    - The Attachment API respects any system limitations on uploaded files, such as maximum file size and allowed attachment types. 
    - You can control these settings using the properties com.glide.attachment.max_size, 1024MB by default, and glide.attachment.extensions.
